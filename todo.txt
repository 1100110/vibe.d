HTTP
====

 - (partially done) add limits for header line length, body size, number of headers or request size and request time to avoid DoS
 - defer writing the header of server responses to the second written chunk in case of using bodyWriter() - if only one chunk is ever written, write non-chunked instead
 - implement generators for http.rest to generate a JavaScript client and "documentation" with all possible requests.

TCP
===

 - Find out what makes the libevent event loop continue to run after all connections have been disconnected
 - Add a DoS barrier that closes old connections in case of high connection counts

GENERAL
=======

 - Asynchronous file I/O
 - Load balancer with support for seemless recompile
 - Use the event_set_*_callback functions to log libevent messages
 - Analyze all code for memory leaks (e.g. SSLContext)
 - Add template arguments to API docs
 - UTF files including byte order mark cannot be parsed, currently
 - Benchmark
 - HTTP server comparison to nginx
 

DIET TEMPLATES
==============

 - comments
 
MARKDOWN FILTER
===============

 - see markdown.d
 - add SmartyPants support

PACKAGE MANAGER
===============

 - only query the VPM registry if there are unmet dependecies or if an upgrade is requested
 - if vibe is called without "build", build the application in %TEMP% to avoid filling application directories with DLLs and EXEs
 - pass a flag -version=VPM_package_xxx to the compiler if module xxx is installed (replace special characters by _)
 - allow the specification of optional dependencies (the user will just get a message)
 - implement outputting of a generated vpm_versions.d module that contains the version of each installed package
 - package signing
